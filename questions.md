1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

~2 hours
If I had more time, I would add tests for the selectors, the actions, and reducers. I would propertly style everything, either using postcss or sass. In general, I would add more tests to everything to cover corner cases. I would add eslint for linting, typescript for type protection. I would add proper paging for the requested resources.

2.       What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

So for javascript, going by what has wide browser support, I would choose destructuring. I've done a lot of work with other languages, like haskell and elixir, and the ability to destruct natively is extremely important. It's allowed me to write code in a more expressive and less error prone way.


3.       How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Performance issues can come from a number of different places. The obvious problems are API calls, but once those are exhausted, I use a debugger to inspect the stack, and see what's eating up all of the processing time.

4.       How would you improve the API that you just used?

I prefer graphql to openapi for api calls. I just find it more intuitive and expressive.

5.       Please describe yourself using JSON.
